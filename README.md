# Learnd Tech Task

## Overarching Requirements

1. As a customer, I would like to know how much energy I have consumed this
month so that I can calculate my electricity bill.

2. As a customer, I would like to compare energy usage between different
buildings where I have Powerwave installed so that I can find opportunities to
save energy.

3. As a customer, I would like to have access to historical energy data so that I
can understand my energy consumption patterns better.
